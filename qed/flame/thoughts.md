Dancing Flames // ? Flames Dance Across ?

# Setup

Put 3 {Presence} on your starting board: 2 in the highest-numbered land with 2 {Dahan}, and 1 in land #2.
Set aside a pool of Scenario markers (or similar piece with no other game meaning) to be used as your {Inflame} tokens.

# Special Rules

## Inflamed Passions
Your abilities can add Inflame ({Inflame}) tokens, which must be attached to Invaders or {Dahan}.

When a piece with any number of {Inflame} deals its normal Damage to Invaders and/or {Dahan}, it deals +1 Damage and Removes one {Inflame}.
Invaders with {Inflame} do not participate in Build.

*During Time Passes*: Each piece with {Inflame} that is not in your lands Removes one {Inflame}, unless you pay 1 Energy (per Invader).

## Heated Disagreements
When your Powers would add {Strife}, you may instead add {Inflame} to that Invader.
Your Powers may treat {Inflame} as {Strife}.
