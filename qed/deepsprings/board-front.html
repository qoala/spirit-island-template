      <special-rule>
        Your abilities can Sequester {blight}. Move Sequestered {blight} to your spirit board. Each revealed {sequestration} on your presence tracks can hold 1 Sequestered {blight}. Keep the rest here.
        <br>
        For each Sequestered {blight} not on your presence tracks, -1 Energy income/turn.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rules-subtitle>Gradual Filtration</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>
        At the end of each Spirit Phase, you may pay 1 Energy to remove 1 Sequestered {blight}. This is treated as if it were being removed from the island.

			Examples include: reclaim-all; reclaim-one; move-presence(1); gain-energy(2);
			Gaining Elements: gain-element(water,fire); gain-element(water,2);
			Adding Presence: add-presence(1); add-presence(1,jungle); add-presence(2,town,city,blight,or); add-presence(2,strife,city,and);
			
			Sub-Groups of Growth are possible (think Lure)
			Example: <sub-growth title="pick one of:" bordered>   here 'bordered' creates the double line border
