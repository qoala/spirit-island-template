            Deep Springs Flow Darkly
        </spirit-name>
        <lore-description>
            When the island suffers, Deep Springs alleviates the worst by sealing impurities away in the rocks through which it flows, but the arrival of the Invaders has brought additional strain.

                    Put 2 {presence} on your starting board: 1 in the highest-numbered Wetlands, 1 in the highest numbered Mountains.
                    <br>
                    Sequester 1 {blight} (from the box) on your spirit board.

                    Can keep {blight} off the island to prevent cascades, but its only a temporary measure.
                    It all comes spilling back out with Release Tainted Waters.
