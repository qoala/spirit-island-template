            Deep Springs Flow Darkly
        </spirit-name>
        <lore-description>
            When the island suffers, Deep Springs alleviates the worst by sealing impurities away in the rocks through which it flows. Aquifers flow deep beneath the island's surface, forming its lifeblood. However, the arrival of the Invaders has brought additional strain to Deep Spring's efforts.

            <br>
            Where pools of clean water once attracted the Dahan, they're learning to avoid springs where the water turns dark.
            Bitter and metallic tastes are only the beginning when toxins can no longer be contained.

                  Put 2 {presence} and 1 {blight} (from the box) on your starting board in the highest-numbered Mountains/Wetlands with or adjacent to {blight}.

                  {blight} builds up in its lands, eventually becoming a torrent of tainted water that sweeps across the island.
                  With a good network of lands, can slowly accumulate {blight} from other boards, though may still encourage more of it than other Spirits may be comfortable with.

                  <br>
                  Is good at preventing cascades, either by drawing {blight} out of the land before it ravages or at the cost of its own {presence}.
