(General)
1. Was it fun?
2. Does the spirit fight invaders in an unique/distinct way?
3. Do the special rule(s) and innate power(s) fit the theme?
4. Are the unique and right-innate powers interesting?
5. Is there any superfluous/unnecessary part?
(Specifics)
6. How large did you get the blight-pile for Tainted Waters? Did it plateau at any notable points (possibly growing again later)?
7. How do the right-innate thresholds feel?
8. Is the blight movement on both 3rd-level innates meaningful and/or overpowered?
9. Do you ever want to use 3rd-level Leach Fields in a land without invaders?
* If on board F with F7 on the edge of the map (especially solo), is starting in a corner with limited adjacency problematic?
* If Festering Pits of Blight (event) occurs, what happened?
